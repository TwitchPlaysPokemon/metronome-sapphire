# Pokémon Metronome Sapphire

Based on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/6q06qu/idea_for_a_future_run/) subreddit post.

Currently planned features:

* All Pokémon only know Metronome during battle/contests.
* All Pokémon are level 100
* Player's party is healed after every battle.
* HM moves only require the HM itself and the relevant badge.
* Encounters are fully random, meaning that each wild Pokémon the player runs into can be of any species in the game.

If you have ideas on how to expand upon this concept to make the game more interesting, open an Issue.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
